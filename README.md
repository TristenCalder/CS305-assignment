# This is the CS305 module 5 assignment
## Here is a synopsis of my CS386 project


# CS386-Project (Walkitoff v. 1.0.0)

## Project Description

The walkitoff application is an alarm app that is intended to get you moving out of your bed. 
How it does this is by setting an alarm like normal but in addition to set an amount of distance (Initial being 500 ft). 
When the alarm goes off, the user must travel the amount of distance they selected by the use of google's mapping location. 
There would also be user levels and scoring connected to a database so that this can be set apart from the rest of the alarms . 
At certain levels, more features of the alarm would be available to the user, such as new alarm sounds and dark mode. 
Once they reach max level, the goal is for the user to be well off without the alarm due to the alarm's main objective of creating better waking habits in the morning.
